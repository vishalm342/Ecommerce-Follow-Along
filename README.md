# Ecommerce-Follow-Along
Welcome to the **Ecommerv+ce Follow Along Project**, this is a hands-on project where we will build a complete e-commerce application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.j)s. The goal is to learn how to developm a full-stack web application step by step.

## Milestone 1: Project Overview

#### 1. Understanding the MERN Stack:
**MongoDB :** A database for storing applicatiom dta in a flexible, document based format.
**Express.js :** A backend web application framework for building APIs and handling server logics.
**React.js :** A freamework library for building User Interfaces.
**Node.js :** A runtime environment that allows javascript to run on the server.

#### 2. REST API Structure
REST APIs are used to allow communication between the frontend and backend.
We'll create APIs for:
-**User Authentication**: Allowing users to register and login.
-**Product Management**: Adding, updating, and retrieving product data.  
-**Order Handling**: Managing customer orders.

#### 3. Database Schema Design
We'll learn how to design and organize data using MongoDB. A schema helps us to define how the data is stored and related.

#### 4. Authentication
Authentication ensures only the right to people who can access certain features. For example:
- Users need to log in to place orders or see their personal data.
- It keeps the app secure by verifying user's identities. 

## Milestone 3:

Set up dedicated folders for organizing backend code effectively. Initialized and configured a Node.js server to handle API requests. Connected the application to MongoDB to store and manage data. Implemented basic error handling to ensure smooth server operation.

## Milestone 4:

Created a User Model to define how user data is structured in the database also developed a User Controller to manage user interactions, like adding or retrieving data. Additionally, configured Multer to handle file uploads, allowing users to store files such as images.

## Milestone 5:

I built the Sign-Up page for user registration using HTML and CSS. I implemented form validation to ensure valid inputs, like email format and password security. This enhances user experience and prevents errors. All changes have been committed and pushed to the repository.

## Milestone 6:

I created a backend signup API that securely stores user data. Passwords are encrypted using bcrypt before saving to MongoDB. The API ensures secure user authentication and data privacy. All changes are committed and pushed.

## Milestone 7:

In this milestone, we implemented user login authentication by validating credentials and comparing encrypted passwords using bcrypt. The process involves retrieving user data, hashing the entered password, and matching it with the stored hash. If authenticated, access is granted; otherwise, an error is returned. This enhances security and protects user data. 

## Milestone 8:

In this milestone, we created a reusable product card component and designed a homepage to display multiple cards dynamically. The component receives product details as props and is rendered using array mapping. This improves UI consistency, enhances user experience, and maintains an organized layout for showcasing products effectively.

## Milestone 9:
In this milestone, we created a product page for the e-commerce website. The page displays a list of products with their details, including images, names, descriptions, and prices. Users can click on a product to view more information or add it to their cart. This page provides a user-friendly interface for browsing and selecting products.
