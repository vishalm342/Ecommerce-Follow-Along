# Ecommerce-Follow-Along
Welcome to the **Ecommerv+ce Follow Along Project**, this is a hands-on project where we will build a complete e-commerce application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.j)s. The goal is to learn how to developm a full-stack web application step by step.

## Milestone 1: Project Overview

#### 1. Understanding the MERN Stack:
**MongoDB :** A database for storing applicatiom dta in a flexible, document based format.
**Express.js :** A backend web application framework for building APIs and handling server logics.
**React.js :** A freamework library for building User Interfaces.
**Node.js :** A runtime environment that allows javascript to run on the server.

#### 2. REST API Structure
REST APIs are used to allow communication between the frontend and backend.
We'll create APIs for:
-**User Authentication**: Allowing users to register and login.
-**Product Management**: Adding, updating, and retrieving product data.  
-**Order Handling**: Managing customer orders.

#### 3. Database Schema Design
We'll learn how to design and organize data using MongoDB. A schema helps us to define how the data is stored and related.

#### 4. Authentication
Authentication ensures only the right to people who can access certain features. For example:
- Users need to log in to place orders or see their personal data.
- It keeps the app secure by verifying user's identities.
